begin
    define my type
    with
        integer n1

    my type obj
    integer k
    the n1 of obj becomes 1
    the n2 of obj becomes 1
    read k
    if k is smaller compared to 1 then just
    begin
        print "Error this will not work"
        stop
    end
    if k is smaller compared to 3 then just
    begin
        print 1
        stop
    end
    k becomes subtract 2 from k
    each i from 1 to k
    begin
        integer new
        new becomes add the n1 of obj to the n2 of obj
        if i is equal compared to k then just
        begin
            print new
            stop
        end
        the n1 of obj becomes the n2 of obj
        the n2 of obj becomes new
